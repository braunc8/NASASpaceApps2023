                    <h2>Little body, big impact</h2>
                    <p class="body">
                        Even though they have small bodies, phytoplankton live in huge blooms, which means they make a big impact. 
                        Phytoplankton are great for the environment! In fact, Phytoplankton take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere
                        in huge amounts! Every year, phytoplankton take around 40% of the total carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
                        This is 30 to 50 billion metric tons[5]! To compare, one tree will remove around 48 pounds of carbon per year.
                        Phytoplankton make big changes[6]!

                    <h2>How do they grow?</h2>
                    <p class="body">
                        Phytoplankton grow using a combination of sunlight, nutrients, wind, and carbon dioxide. 
                        Depending on conditions, phytoplankton can grow very quickly, and when they are in large numbers,
                         they can consume huge amounts of carbon dioxide, which is great for our environment [7].
