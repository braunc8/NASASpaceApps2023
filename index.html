                    <p class="body">
                        Each day, the ocean can make huge changes in our environment, without us even knowing! 
                        The ocean helps us humans in many ways, from giving us fish to eat to giving us a place to swim.
                        The ocean also contains many interesting creatures including a little plant called a phytoplankton.
                        The phytoplankton is small, but helps us in a big way to fight climate change.

                    <h2> What is climate change?</h2>
                    <p class="body">
                        Climate is different from weather because climate describes the typical weather for a long period of time. 
                        Climate change is the long-term change in our Earth’s environment. It refers to many effects like rising
                        temperatures, ocean levels rising, and the shrinking of glaciers [1]. Climate change is caused by too many 
                        greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A greenhouse gas is a gas which raises Earth’s temperature when it is in
                        the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases include Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Water Vapour [2].

                        <p, class = "body">
                            A bloom is a large amount of phytoplankton ( or other kinds of 
                            algaes ) all growing in the same area [3].
